Two tortoises named A and B must run a race. A starts with an average speed of 720 feet per hour. Young B knows she runs faster than A and furthermore has not finished her cabbage.

When she starts, at last, she can see that A has a 70 feet lead but B speed is 850 feet per hour. How long will it take B to catch A?

More generally: given two speeds v1 (A speed, integer > 0) and v2 (B speed, integer > 0) and a lead g (integer > 0) how long will it take B to catch A?

The result will be an array [h, mn, s] where h, mn, s is the time needed in hours, minutes and seconds (don't worry for fractions of second). If v1 >= v2 then return nil, nothing, null, None or {-1, -1, -1} for C++.

function race(v1, v2, g) {
    // your code
    //find the amount of time v1 has already been running
    if( v1 >= v2) {
      return null
    }
    
    var dif = 3600 * g/(v2 - v1);
    console.log(dif)
    
   var th = parseInt(dif/3600);
   var tm = parseInt(dif/60 % 60);

   var ts = parseInt(dif % 60) 
   
   arr = [th, tm, ts];
   return arr;
}
