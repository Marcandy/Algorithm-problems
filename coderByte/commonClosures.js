// The goal of the code above is to alert the numbers 0, 1, and 2 each after 1, 1.1, and 1.2 seconds, respectively. The problem though, is that if you run the above code in your console, you actually get the number 3 alerted 3 times after 1, 1.1, and 1.2 seconds. This is because of an issue with JavaScript closures. Click here to run the above code and see the output for yourself.
//
// A JavaScript closure is when an inner function has access to its outer enclosing function's variables and properties. In the code above, the following line of code:

for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(function() {
    alert(i);
  }, 1000 + 1);
}

// uses a variable i which is declared outside of itself. The variable i is actually declared within the for loop and the inner function accesses it. So when the for loop is done running, each of the inner functions refers to the same variable i, which at the end of the loop is equal to 3. Our goal is for each inner function to maintain its reference to the variable i without the value of it being altered. We'll solve this using an IIFE, or an immediately-invoked function expression.

for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(function(i_local) {
    return function() {alert(i_local); }
  }(i), 1000 + i);
}

// We pass the variable i into the outer function as a local variable named i_local, where we then return a function that will alert the i_local for us. This should now correctly alert the numbers 0, 1, and 2 in the correct order. Click here to run this new code.


//2)------------------------------
var addSix = createBase(6);
addSix(10); //return 16
addSix(21); //return 27

// You can create a closure to keep the value passed to the function createBase even after the inner function is returned. The inner function that is being returned is created within an outer function, making it a closure, and it has access to the variables within the outer function, in this case the variable baseNumber.


function createBase(baseNumber) {
  return function(N) {
    //we are referenceing baseNumber here even though it was declared
    // outside of this function. Closures allow us to do this in JavaScript
    return baseNumber + N;
  }
}

var addSix = createBase(6);
addSix(10);
addSix(21);


//3)----------------------------
// You can create a function within an outer function (a closure) that allows you to update a private variable but the variable wouldn't be accessible from outside the function without the use of a helper function.

function counter() {
  var _counter = 0;
  // return an object with several functions that allow you
  // to modify the private _counter variable
  return {
    add: function(increment) { _counter += increment; },
    retrieve: function() { return 'The counter is currently at: ' + _counter; }
  }
}

// error if we try to access the private variable like below
// _counter;

// usage of our counter function
var c = counter();
c.add(5);
c.add(9);

// now we can access the private variable in the following way
c.retrieve(); // => The counter is currently at: 14
