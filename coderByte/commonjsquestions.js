// 1) A very simply way to check if a number is a decimal or integer is to see if there is a remainder left when you divide by 1.
function isInt(num) {
  return num % 1 === 0;
}

console.log(isInt(4)); // true
console.log(isInt(12.2)); // false
console.log(isInt(0.3)); // false

// 2)What will the following code output?
// (function() {
//   var a = b = 5;
// })();

// console.log(b);

The code above will output 5 even though it seems as if the variable was declared within a function and can't be accessed outside of it. This is because
var a = b = 5;
is interpreted the following way:
var a = b;
b = 5;
But b is not declared anywhere in the function with var so it is set equal to 5 in the global scope.

// 3Write a function that would allow you to do this.
// multiply(5)(6);
// You can create a closure to keep the value of a even after the inner function is returned. The inner function that is being returned is created within an outer function, making it a closure, and it has access to the variables within the outer function, in this case the variable a.
function multiply(a) {
  return function(b) {
    return a * b;
  }
}

multiply(5)(6);

// 4) When would you use the bind function?
function fullName() {
  return "Hello, this is " + this.first + " " + this.last;
}

console.log(fullName()); // => Hello this is undefined undefined

// create a person object and pass its values to the fullName function
var person = {first: "Foo", last: "Bar"};
console.log(fullName.bind(person)()); // => Hello this is Foo Bar

// 5)What does "use strict" do?
The "use strict" literal is entered at the top of a JavaScript program or at the top of a function and it helps you write safer JavaScript code by throwing an error if a global variable is created by mistake. For example, the following program will throw an error:
function doSomething(val) {
  "use strict"; 
  x = val + 10;
}
It will throw an error because x was not defined and it is being set to some value in the global scope, which isn't allowed with "use strict" The small change below fixes the error being thrown:
function doSomething(val) {
  "use strict"; 
  var x = val + 10;

  
//   6) What is the difference between == and ===?
The difference is that == performs implicit type conversion to check if values are equal to each other. So it will convert the values to true or false boolean values and then compare them. Below are some weird results of this implicit type conversion using the double equal operator:
"1" == 1 // true
true == 1 // true
[] == false // true
"" == false // true
undefined == null // true
This can really cause some problems when you're writing JavaScript, so the safe thing to do is use the triple equal operator instead, which checks that the two values are of the same type and does not perform type conversion.
"1" === 1 // false
true === 1 // false
[] === false // false
"" === false // false
undefined === null // false

// 7) 7How would you add your own method to the Array object so the following code would work?
// var arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
// var avg = arr.average();
// console.log(avg);

Array.prototype.average = function() {
  // calculate sum
  var sum = this.reduce(function(prev, cur) { return prev + cur; });
  // return sum divided by number of elements
  return sum / this.length;
}

var arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
var avg = arr.average();
console.log(avg); // => 3
// Now every array that is created will have the average method inherited along with every other Array method. But, you need to be careful with modifying the prototype of an object, because you can mistakenly overwrite a common method.

// 8)Explain what a callback function is and provide a simple example.

A callback function is a function that is passed to another function as an argument and is executed after some operation has been completed. Below is an example of a simple callback function that logs to the console after some operations have been completed.
function modifyArray(arr, callback) {
  // do something to arr here
  arr.push(100);
  // then execute the callback function that was passed
  callback();
}

var arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

modifyArray(arr, function() {
  console.log("array has been modified", arr);
});

// 9)What will the following code output?

This will surprisingly output false because of floating point errors in internally representing certain numbers. 0.1 + 0.2 does not nicely come out to 0.3 but instead the result is actually 0.30000000000000004 because the computer cannot internally represent the correct number. One solution to get around this problem is to round the results when doing arithmetic with decimal numbers.

// 10) How would you create a private variable in JavaScript?
To create a private variable in JavaScript that cannot be changed you need to create it as a local variable within a function. Even if the function is executed the variable cannot be accessed outside of the function. For example:
function func() {
  var priv = "secret code";
}

console.log(priv); // throws error
To access the variable, a helper function would need to be created that returns the private variable.
function func() {
  var priv = "secret code";
  return function() {
    return priv;
  }
}

var getPriv = func();
console.log(getPriv()); // => secret code
